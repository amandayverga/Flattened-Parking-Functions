# Flattened-Parking-Functions
This is code from [Summer@ICERM 2022](https://icerm.brown.edu/summerug/2022/) in Computational Combinatorics for generating totals of flattened parking functions satisfying particular parameters. 

The **01-Totals** code generates the total number of flattened parking functions of length $n$.

The **02-Insertion Totals** code generates the total number of flattened parking functions of length $n$, with the elements of a multiset $\mathcal{S}$ inserted. Note that the multiset $\mathcal{S}$ contains elements from $[n+1]$.

The **03-Generating Sums** code is used to verify that ____
